It is launch time. Welcome! A start to a journey of discovery and exploration. We will look for the new, the strange, and the unknown. We will have (almost!) everyday something new for you.

Our core subjects and discussions will be:

-   Gforth Programming Language

-   C Programming Language

-   Linux

-   Embedded Systems

-   IoT Systems

We will also see how we can use them combined. Our mini-projects in the LC-Forth series will challenge your problem solving skills. Can this be a new way to program? This is what we would like to discover.

Most of all, this is a fun and curious way to learn. No matter your skill level, here will be something of interest and you just might learn a think or two (maybe even more!).

Email me if you have ideas, questions or very polite criticism. Go-Forth and see YOU! on the other side.
